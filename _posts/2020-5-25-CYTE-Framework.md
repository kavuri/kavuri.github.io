title: The CYTE Framework - Are you tripping over the "tech edge"
---

In today’s world, it is imperative that every business has to use technology as one of the main ingredients. Be it customer acquisition using a website, communication, managing the CRM systems and all the way to a sophisticated process life cycle management systems & data analytics, technology and the corresponding way technology is organized plays a pivotal role.

It all begins with You envisioning a beautiful product, checking the market, using a certain technology to build the product and launching it. Behold! your product has been selling quite well and you get into the groove to sell more copies of it - sounds familiar for all successful companies?

You have been running the company for a few years (say 5+ years) and think that you had the market. Then comes a new kid off the block (let’s call it the X company) with a spanky new way of doing exactly what you have been offering but producing the product at a much cheaper cost with the best of the user experience and at a lower price. And then you start to scramble. Your product managers start to run around trying to compare your product with X’s, going to your customers to convince them why they should not move to X, but you clearly know that your market share is slowly withering out. Top guys meet, quite often regularly to discuss this topic, trying to figure out the challenge in front of you and how to tackle it.

Sounds familiar?

What do you attribute this to?

You realize that it all boils down to a combination of  **technology**  and  **product**  shortcomings (one enabling the other). Some signals are like,

-   difficulty in adding & releasing features at a faster rate
-   a UX that does not tally to the bottom-line of today's experiences
-   teams spending more time on meetings rather than to execute & deliver
-   engineers take shortcuts to making changes to the software platform, because customers want the changes  **today**

These signals if not caught and handled could take the company into a downward spiral that would be difficult to get out of. Remember the cost of technology overhaul is way higher and riskier vis-a-vis regular incremental overhauls. Also remember that technology changes very fast, so one has to keep a hawk’s eye on adapt accordingly

Let’s dig into the details

Most of the time, after a period of success, business leaders consider technology as a secondary citizen. Most of the focus is on increasing the market share (nothing wrong with it) and to a lower extent on revamping the technology to make the company competitive in the fast changing technology space. Any updates / upheaval of the technology stack is looked down as cost and approvals are not to come by.

In my experience, in order for a company to thrive, it has to look in the next 2-4 years from now and assess if your current technology/product UX can give you the same or better advantage.

Do you know where Your company stands?

This framework, I call the “Check Your Tech Edge” (CYTE Framework for short) is a positional matrix to give a company an understanding of where you stand w.r.t your technology, architecture and whether it has the ability to sustain, compete & thrive in your business.

I have considered the following top-level factors (but not limited) to determine where a company’s technology stands ***today***

-   Ability to launch new product using the same platform without compromising on the architectural integrity
-   Time taken to develop a new feature
-   Time taken to release the new feature
-   Ability of the stack/platform to support A/B testing of a feature
-   Turn around time to handle customer requests/issues
-   An automated mechanism to obtain, assess customer feedback on the usage, experience of your products
-   Ability of your platform to scale up/down with varying demand
-   Effective resource utilization of your infrastructure (sparse utilization of the infrastructure show’s a sub-standard architecture and technology in place)
-   Support for automated deployments
-   Ability to extract value out of the data one holds (in other words have an analytics, data strategy in place)
-   How efficient is the operations resources to maintain and manage your software stack

I am not considering the functional & product aspects (like security, performance etc.), as it is imperative that you are still in the business because of those compliance's. My focus is whether your company will effectively be able to compete and thrive in the next 2-4 years from today.

Each of these attributes are quantitative, but also carry a certain qualitative nature. Once the evaluation of these attributes is complete, you would have the company in question in one of the quadrants and at a certain position. Clearly, a good company should be in the “Ecosystem driver” quadrant and possibly at the top right.

![The CYTE quadrant framework](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHE5RYIMMa_Dg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1597276800&v=beta&t=NICXLhLveGWXaKI3Yo-3NONXG7urYAHnG9TcloMzS2E)

The horizontal axis gives the relative strength of your business in your industry. The vertical axis defines the ability of the technology to adapt to the changes (internal or external)

Let me go thru each of these quadrants and their significance

## **The Laggard / beginner**

Your technology will deliver the similar quality of service software for the next 2 years and has a low barrier of entry to be disrupted. You could be a startup or an incumbent (even worse) and it is high time You had a considerable investment to ramp up on the technology front. Your product is either sub-standard or does not have the longevity to sustain over a period of time

## **Niche**

You are an incumbent in this space and your business is niche and hard to replace. Examples of “Niche” are in the areas of government projects, extensive integrations to multiple customer ERP systems. Even though players in this space enjoy an extended period of monopoly, all it takes is a sudden event that makes the customers realize the lack of some basic accessibilities, or an inability to scale that reflects on the quality of service levels, or another strong player that would replace the incumbent. Given the fact that it takes considerable effort to overhaul the technology, the business needs to recognize the importance to move into the ecosystem quadrant or be severely disrupted

## **Dabbler**

You are well-suited to create an ecosystem in the space you are, but your core business is not profitable or proven yet. This represents mostly a “tech-heavy”, but not a “business focused” company(remember Sun Microsystems?). You have made heavy investments in technology, but are unsure on how to reap the benefits from it. Maintaining the software in itself becomes a part of the daily work, that could easily pull you down into “Laggards” quadrant, in case the business leader decides a slashing in the technology spends

## **Ecosystem driver**

A company in this quadrant has become successful in its core business and at the sametime has realized the importance of technology, architecture and managed, upgraded, tuned and put into the best use to drive the growth of the company. All the good companies have realized the importance of technology and have managed it effectively

Now, the question goes, how do you want to ensure you are not locked in the “dabbler” or “niche” quadrant, but create the ability to move into the “ecosystem driver” quadrant (clearly no one wants to be in the “laggard” quadrant). Most of the times, the engineering teams are designed to execute on the current targets/goals, but not on future technology strategy.

With this framework, my hope is to give the R&D organization a tool to effectively assess their current state and help steer the company into a tech strong direction
